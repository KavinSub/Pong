# Pong
My attempt at recreating Pong in java.
I spent the past couple days learning how to implement GUI in java, by watching videos online. As a fun project, I decided to try
and implement Pong.
To run the project type:
java -jar Pong.jar
On the command line. Player 1 moves with the w and s keys, and Player 2 moves with the up and down arrow keys.
